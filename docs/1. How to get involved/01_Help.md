# How to help out

The reason you are reading this is great! Probably you came here to see what this is all about and maybe to contribute your piece for a better world🌍. Contributing to Delft Open Hardware can be super simple and should never feel like a burden, it can be something as simple as adding a switch to a piece of hardware or review a snippet of code.
## Steps to contribute:
1. Find a project you like on Airtable
2. Get in contact with the project members.
3. Have a look at the tasks related to this project
4. Let everyone know that you are doing a specific task
5. Get sh*t done
6. Let us know you did it and how it went, or recommended follow-ups
7. Celebrate that you just made the world a tiny bit better!

Community channels tools and resources

We know it’s a bit much, but we have a couple of different platforms for different purposes

- [Drive general assets and docs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CgCgCph-xXBJVNpdNK-vyDLphM-BRHXe?usp=sharing): Place for public documentation, notes about meetups, media kit etc. etc.

- [Airtable for org](https://airtable.com/tblxLDQAvqPRoEVNI/viw5LBSWGeWKYZBie?blocks=hide): Organization of different projects, task assignment, project progress and community activities.

- [Gitlab repos and groups for project development](https://gitlab.com/go-commons/delftopenhardware): Actual documentation of the projects, easy to fork and simple to contribute

<!-- - [Telegram for chating](https://t.me/DelftOpenHardware): Daily communication tool, announcements, always open for questions and interesting links -->

- Meetups: We like to get together once in a while, we mostly announce it on the telegram but you can also find it on the landing page.
